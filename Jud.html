    <h1>Who Am I???</h1>
    <p>I'm Judie Rey P. Salinas, and I'm 19 years old. I also live in Quezon City.
         I'm a second-year student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines,
          studying Bachelor of Science in Office Administration.
          <br><br>
         I was born and raised in a humble household. My parents are both bisaya,
          with my mother being from Agusan Del Sur. My father was in Leyte at the time.
           My mother is a stay-at-home mom, and my father is an OFW.
            He is currently employed as a Rigger in Saudi Arabia. Tin is the name of my younger sibling.
             She is currently working to support my parents with their finances.
              She momentarily ceased attending school in order to provide.
               And I'm the only Christian in our family, the rest of them are Roman Catholics.

                <p>I didn't study a lot throughout elementary and junior high school.
                 I'm simply a "happy-go-lucky" person.  I don't worry about my grades till I reach the tenth grade.
                  My classmate is someone who motivates me to continue my studies.
                   He was the class president at the time.
                    And from what I've seen of him, he's a zealot when it comes to school.
                     He's not even that smart, but he succeeds simply by working hard.
                      That's why I told myself that no matter what, if I'm strategic enough,
                       I can acquire the things I want. When I get to senior high school,
                        I'm always an honor student. I'm already a second-year college student,
                         and by the grace of God, I've always been on the President's List.
                         <br><br> 
                         I'm a joyous individual who enjoys being around people who share my personality
                          because I believe I can completely connect with them.
                           And I'm the type of friend who is always there for them;
                            when I have something to offer when they are in need,
                             I make every effort to support them.
                              My friends even refer to me as their mother because
                               I have a motherly demeanor.
                               <br><br>
                               There is one thing I have learned in my life.
                                If you keep doing things, you will be completely successful
                                 in due time. Continue to walk regardless of what happens.
                                  Failures are unavoidable. However,
                                   giving up will prevent you from experiencing the supernatural.</p>
